Hi! I'm Kelvin and this is my submission for the Snap Engineering Academy Project Assessment.

This is my second time creating a website but I wanted to put a lot of effort into it to showcase what I've learned in the last 2 years at community college as well as something fun for my personal brand! 
(I enjoy content creation on the side and I really love food.)

Iâ€™m currently pursuing a career shift into software engineering, but my path here has been non-traditional. I started out at community college at Pasadena City College before earning my undergraduate degree in Economics from UCLA (totally left field from what I do now). After graduating and working in finance for a few years, I realized that it didn't particularly line up with my goals and interests...

I only really discovered what I wanted to do when I looked back on a previous experience where
I was a mentor for an organization at UCLA called ALLbrains, which supports neurodiverse individuals like myself. It taught me that I really loved helping people and I hope to help people that are like me. I found that I best express it through crafting fun and unique solutions whether it's just ideas, talking through things, or drawing things out! I always thought coding was kinda cool but intimidating but I wanted to combine my thinking with those feelings!

This ultimately led me to return back to community college, an experience that I really enjoyed for its small and intimate learning experience, where I got to really thrive! I'm currently in the process of transferring to a Master's program (hopefully) in the near future and would love the opportunity to learn and grow around like-minded individuals and just be in a space where I can contribute to projects/work in a meaningful way.

Shoutout to my wife for supporting me throughout this journey and helping me create my banner! Shoutout to all the amazing professors I've learned under at the various community colleges I've taken classes at recently and for my close friends and family for supporting my large career pivot!

Thank you for taking the time to read this and I hope you enjoy my work! (I spent many, many, many hours in these 5 days to build this...)
